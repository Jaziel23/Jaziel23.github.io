          One of the games that I will be reviewing is Portal 2. This is one
          of my personal favorites. After the events of the first game, our
          main character begins their journey to escape a facility.
          Throughout the game, you encounter various characters which may
          help her escape or may hinder her efforts to do so. The main
          component that makes this game so unique from others is the portal
          gun. Using the device you are able to, surprisingly, make 2
          portals that allow you to move from one place to another. The
          complexity of each level is one that is very rare to find in
          games, especially in its consistency. In addition to the complex
          levels, the storytelling and the characters are some of the most
          memorable and unique things in modern storytelling. In my opinion,
          this game is without a doubt, a 10 out of 10.

          There very rarely comes a game as unique as Majora's Mask. Despite
          being 23 years old now, it remains a timeless classic that defies
          the constraints of its era. Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64,
          Majora's Mask captivated players with its unconventional
          time-based mechanics, dark atmosphere, and intricate narrative. The
          game's innovative three-day cycle, where players must navigate the
          impending apocalypse and manipulate time to save the world of
          Termina, set it apart from its predecessors and contemporaries.
          Majora's Mask goes beyond traditional gaming experiences, delving
          into existential themes of loss, acceptance, and the inevitable
          passage of time. Its haunting soundtrack, terrifying imagery, and
          emotionally powerful characters make an immersive experience that
          is unforgettable Despite the evolution of gaming technology,
          Majora's Mask endures as a masterpiece, a testament to the power of
          storytelling and game design that transcends the boundaries of its
          time. It is absolutely a 10 out of 10, and a game everybody should
          play at least once in their lives.
