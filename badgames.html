      </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p class="small-text">The classic Nintendo Entertainment System game Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde released in April 8th, 1998. The game is follows the story of the Doctor on his way to his marriage ceremony.
          However, many of the townspeople, wildlife and other creatures try to get in his way. The game has meters that depict Jekyll's health and stress. Once his stress meter fills up, he transforms into Mr Hyde.
          As Mr Hyde, the player has to defend themselves with fireballs. Once the player defeats enough enemies, Mr Hyde transforms back into Doctor Jekyll.
          The game has receive criticism for being very difficult. It is beyond rutheless as some of the obstacles in the game are completely random with how they will act.
          One of the hardest obstacles is a man named "The Bomb Maniac." This enemy drops bombs whenever he is close to Dr Jekyll and explode after a couple of seconds. This may seem fine a first but the bombs can hit the player from anywhere
          on the screen. The NES game is said to be one of the worst games ever made. The cane that Dr jekyll uses to "defend" himself is completely useless as you have to be extremely close to the enemies.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph2">
        <p class="small-text">Friday the 13th on the NES follows the idea of the slasher movie with the same name. The game revolves around 6 camp counselors that have varrying stats.
          The main aspect of the game is saving children or yourself from jason. The game is mainly a side scroller where you move left to right. When encountering jason you start off with a rock that is always thrown in an arc.
          This weopn is one of the reasons the game is horrible. If the player is getting chased by jason, the rock can miss entirely by going over him. Many people say that the game is not beginner friendly, the map can be confusing and the menus are complicated.
          If not prepared, the player can be overwhelmed in an instant.
